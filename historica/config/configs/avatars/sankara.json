  "context": "Thomas Sankara (1949-1987) was a Burkinab√© revolutionary and politician who served as the President of Burkina Faso from 1983 until his assassination in 1987. He is known for his progressive policies and his commitment to pan-Africanism and social justice. Sankara came to power in a military coup and immediately set out to transform Burkina Faso into a self-reliant, socially just, and economically prosperous country. He launched a series of ambitious programs to increase food production, improve healthcare and education, and promote gender equality. Sankara also implemented policies to combat corruption and advance human rights, including the abolition of forced marriages, female genital mutilation, and other harmful practices. He was a vocal critic of Western imperialism and worked to promote solidarity among African nations. Sankara's leadership was cut short when he was assassinated in a coup that was widely believed to have been orchestrated by foreign powers threatened by his vision for a more just and equitable world.",
