    "output": "The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a complex cell-signaling system in the human body that plays a role in regulating a variety of functions and processes including mood, appetite, sleep, and pain. The ECS is composed of endocannabinoids (naturally produced compounds similar to cannabinoids), receptors (CB1 and CB2) that endocannabinoids and cannabinoids bind to, and enzymes that break down these compounds. When cannabis is consumed, the cannabinoids in the plant (such as THC and CBD) interact with the ECS. THC binds with CB1 receptors, mainly in the brain, and this binding is what causes psychoactive effects or the feeling of being high. CBD, on the other hand, does not bind directly with CB1 or CB2 receptors but influences them, often resulting in therapeutic effects such as reducing inflammation and anxiety."
