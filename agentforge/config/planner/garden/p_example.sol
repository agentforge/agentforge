In order to grow tomatoes in plot1 and carrots in plot2, you should start by using a shovel to dig a hole in plot1. Next, sow tomato seeds in the hole. After that, dig another hole in plot2 using the shovel and sow carrot seeds in this hole. Once the seeds are sown, fill a watering can with water from the water source and water both plot1 and plot2 to ensure the seeds are well hydrated. Make sure to return the tools and packets to their original places after use. This series of steps will result in tomatoes growing in plot1 and carrots in plot2, fulfilling the gardening objectives.
