You have a garden with three plots, namely plotA, plotB, and plotC. You have cucumber seeds, pepper seeds, and sunflower seeds. There is also a hose with a limited water supply, a trowel, and a small rake available. Initially, plotA has weeds that need to be removed. You want to plant cucumber seeds in plotA, pepper seeds in plotB, and sunflower seeds in plotC. After planting, you need to water all the plots using the hose. Finally, ensure that the hose is turned off and all the tools are placed back where they were.
