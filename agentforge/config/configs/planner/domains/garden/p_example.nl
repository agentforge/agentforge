You have a garden with 3 plots (plot1, plot2, plot3), a watering can, a packet of tomato seeds, a packet of carrot seeds, and a shovel. Initially, the watering can is empty and all plots are unplanted and dry. You need to plant tomatoes in plot1, carrots in plot2, and then water both plots. Additionally, plot3 needs to be kept empty. Your goal is to have tomatoes growing in plot1, carrots growing in plot2, and both plots watered.
