# Textbook Generation and Model Fine-Tuning Using GPT-4

Summary of [Textbooks Are All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11644)

For future implmentation/consideration.

Summary:
1. Initial Analysis:
   - The team first analyzed a standard code dataset called "The Stack" and found it to be confusing for beginners, with many examples lacking educational value.

   - GPT-4 was used to assess the educational value of 100,000 samples from "The Stack" for students learning basic coding concepts.

2. Dataset Filtering:
   - A random forest classifier was trained to filter the rest of "The Stack" dataset for high educational value.

3. Textbook Generation:
   - GPT-3 was utilized to create textbooks tailored for different audiences. These textbooks included concepts, questions, and answers to demonstrate the concepts.

4. Model Fine-Tuning:
   - A small GPT-3 model (1% the size of the full GPT-3) was fine-tuned on a code completion set generated by GPT-3.
   - The fine-tuning, which required less than 1% of the training compute, led to a significant improvement in capabilities and allowed the model to generalize solutions to tasks outside the fine-tuning dataset.

5. Performance:
   - The fine-tuned model achieved a 51% score on the HumanEval benchmark, surpassing GPT-3.5's 47% score with a model size less than 1% of the parameters. However, it still scored lower than GPT-4, which achieved 67%.

6. Insight:
   - The use of GPT-3 and GPT-4 in dataset preparation demonstrates the importance of considering dataset creation as part of the compute resources invested in model training.
   - The approach indicates that leveraging higher intelligence in dataset creation can enhance the performance of models with simpler architectures.
